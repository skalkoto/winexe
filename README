Build instructions
------------------

Instruction is for Ubuntu 12.10,
but similar steps can be performed on any other distribution.

Install build dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64

Install dependencies for shared version:

    sudo apt-get install ...

Download samba sources for static version:

    git clone git://git.samba.org/samba.git samba

Build shared version:

    cd source
    ./waf configure
    ./waf

For static version you should pass location of samba dir:

    ./waf configure --samba-dir=...

Build system try to find paths to includes/libs,
but you can provide it directly using configuration options:
    --samba-inc-dirs
    --samba-lib-dirs

If you are interested only in static version of winexe
you can use configuration option:
    --disable-shared
